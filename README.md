# Crowdfunding_ETL

We did this project in order to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regex. 

After we transformed the data we created for CSV files and then used the CSV files data to create an ERD and table schema.

We then uploaded the CSV files into a postgres database.
